## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

My first public project helped me practice some basic, but very important HTML & CSS concepts, such as proper markup, using descriptive class names and setting the proper width of components.

### Continued development

Component sizing is still a skill that I need to practice.
